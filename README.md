Before run the code , install the openCV and DeepFace module in python
For OpenCV install: pip install opencv-python
For DeepFace install: pip install deepface
Sometime VS code have some interruptions during installation of modules, so i prefer jupyter notebook over it for opencv.
Firstly, download the anaconda navigator, then install it.
In the anaconda , there is a option of jupyter notebook for installation, install it.
Open the jupyter notebook, upload the python code file and open it.
install the modules of opencv and deepface in jupyter notebook, in python file.
After installation of module, run the code.
